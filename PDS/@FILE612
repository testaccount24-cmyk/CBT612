//***FILE 612 is from Albert Cheng and contains handy TSO utilities *   FILE 612
//*           that run on MVS.  DSPACE, DUASD and LOCATE are        *   FILE 612
//*           originally from the CBT Tape.  They have been         *   FILE 612
//*           enhanced to support the new functions of MVS such as  *   FILE 612
//*           4-digit unit numbers, dynamic link libraries, and     *   FILE 612
//*           so forth.  The utilities are described below.         *   FILE 612
