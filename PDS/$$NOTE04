Hi Sam,

I added a new utility program DELINUSE that is used to delete a
dataset which cannot be deleted by an IBM utility. For example a
dataset is in use in VOLUME A but the same dataset name exists in
VOLUME B. You cannot delete the dataset in VOLUME B because it is
in use on volume Â  I also fixed bugs in utility DSPACE.

Regards,
Albert Cheng
