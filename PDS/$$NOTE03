Hi Sam,

The 'LOCATE' command does not need to be APF authorized if the user
gives read access to the RACF FACILITY profile CSVDYNL.*.TEST.

DEFINE RACF FACILITY PROFILE CSVDYNL.*.TEST
CLASS      NAME
-----      ----
FACILITY   CSVDYNL.*.TEST (G)

LOCATE DOES NOT NEED TO BE DEFINED AS AUTHORIZED COMMAND IN
IKJTSO00. YOU MUST HAVE READ ACCESS RIGHT OF THE ABOVE
RACF PROFILE.  YOU CAN THEN LINK-EDIT LOCATE WITH AC=0.
