Hi Sam,

I've updated file 612.

Summary of the changes

1. DSPACE is enhanced to display 3390 model number.
2. New REXX utility to display SVC recording table to find out
   which SVC are changed by 3rd party software after IPL
3. New assembler program to catalogue a new datasets in a new IPL
   pack which is used for z/OS version uograde.
4. New assembler program BLOCATE to locate command in batch as
   some installation do not allow to update IKJTSO00

I also have a modified version of disassembler program which can
disassemble the new RI BRC instruction with label but it does not
support 64 bit instruction.  Do you want me package with a new
CBT file or within CBT 612?

It produces the following results:

A000342  L     R15,A0010D8
         LA    R1,A001034
         BASR  R14,R15
         LTR   R15,R15                 ;
         JZ    A000372                     RI JUMP
         MVC   708(8,R13),A0011BC
         L     R3,120(,R9)
         MVC   16(8,R3),A0011CC
         ST    R15,8(,R3)
         LHI   R8,20                       RI INSTR
         ST    R8,172(,R13)
         J     A000CEE                     RI JUMP
A000372  OI    476(R13),X'20'
         L     R15,A0010D8             ;

Regards,
Albert
