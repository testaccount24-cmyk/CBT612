Hi Sam,

My ex-colleague in UK requests me to enhance LISTPDS (CBT Tape
File 316) to add new option UNLOAD to create a unload file with
exactly the same LRECL and BLKSIZE of the source PDS.  I also
re-structure LISTPDS with jump instruction and the program only
requires 1 data register and one code register (i.e. The original
version requires 3 program code registers).  I put my updated
version of LISTPDS into file 612.  The LOCATE is also enhanced
and remove the prolog/epilog macro.

Regards,
Albert
